### notes on what i'm currently doing 

20:01

finally started back on the project after a week-ish long hiatus. this allowed me time to gather my thoughts and appropriately plan for my next steps.

i am working on the `move_chars` function in `src/vga_buffer.rs`, which handles the moving of characters when the index of cursor position is not equal to the index of the text position.

the function should be called when this condition is satisfied, on backspace (to move the characters left) and on keyboard input (to move the characters right)

##### updates

20:42

- still working on `move_chars`. figuring out where and when to change `cursor_position` and `column_position`

22:21

- took a short break (made tea yum)
- undid deletion of `delete_byte`... that works fine as is, and should probably make changes in `move_chars`

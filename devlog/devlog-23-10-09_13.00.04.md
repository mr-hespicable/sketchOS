# overall game plan B)

1. create the os
2. build bootloader for the os (?)

#### the creation of the os will be divided into parts, to make it easier to break down and learn.

- [ ] create the barebones kernel
    - [x] initialize the freestanding rust binary
    - [ ] build the kernal
    - [ ] figure out how to print text to the screen
- [ ] set up interrupts
    - [ ] set up cpu exceptions
    - [ ] set up double fault exceptions
    - [ ] set up hardware interrupts
- [ ] set up memory management
    - [ ] implement paging
    - [ ] add heap allocation
- [ ] set up multitasking
    - [ ] async/await

#### more things, scratch notes etc

- POST normally means power on self test, which is when the computer checks if everything is as it should
- kernal will boot from bios rather than uefi
- for now, we will use bootimage thing (maybe bootloader made in the future?)
- kernal complexity and bootloader complexity are inversely proportional
- unsafe blocks should go around all memory writes

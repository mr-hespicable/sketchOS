### starting work on exceptions and interrupts now

the interrupt descriptor table should have a life as long as the code (in this case, the operating system)
- for this reason, we use a lazy static when we declare the interrupt descriptor table (outside of the init function).
- then, we just have IDT.load() in the init func instaed of declaring it inside the init func.

update: 22:48:28:
why isnt the interrupt test workinggggggggg

update: 22:50:05:
it was because i hadn't initlaized the test function so it didn't do anything <33333333
note to self: make sure to initialize things.

update: 22:56:10:
added interrupts for breakpoint
i have to add all the other ones, and also implement double faults.
this is because if double faults dont work then triple faults will hjappen
these are not good.

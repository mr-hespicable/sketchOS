### starting work on exceptions and interrupts now

the interrupt descriptor table should have a life as long as the code (in this case, the operating system)
- for this reason, we use a lazy static when we declare the interrupt descriptor table (outside of the init function).
- then, we just have IDT.load() in the init func instaed of declaring it inside the init func.

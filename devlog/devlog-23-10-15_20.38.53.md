notes for today:

if we see this:
```
Error: panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
left: `'.'`,
right: `'S'`', src/vga_buffer.rs:205:9
```

we have to keep WRITER locked for the duration of whatever is happening.
so, wrap it in this: 
```
interrupts::without_interrupts(|| {
    //code goes here
});
```
and declare the `lock()` method explicitly: 
```
let mut writer = WRITER.lock(); 
writer.buffer.chars[bar]
``` 
instead of 
```
let foo = WRITER.lock().buffer.chars[bar]
```

### notes for today

for the cursor, i think the idea is that:
    1. we get the foreground and background color of the square
    2. we invert it

done. because that's how it normally works!
probably remove the colorcode type... maybe set colorcode and stuff to just a fg: Color and bg: Color then declare colorcode itself seperately?

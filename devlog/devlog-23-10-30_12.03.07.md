- it is the afternoon, starting now.
- a brief recap from yesterday:
    - i left off working on the implementation of `self.text_column`.
    - after this is done, i'll continue working on `delete_byte`.

15:30
- giving up on re-implementing `self.text_column`, just gonna change name to `self.write_column`
- for unity `self.text_row` is now `self.write_row`

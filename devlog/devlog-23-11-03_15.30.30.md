22:30:
maybe i should use debugging more ngl

22:37
starting configuration of debugger

23:36

good morning... it's the next day. I've figured out how to use gdb!
now i'm working with the for loops in `move_chars`, specifically the ones dealing w columns

10:10
I think i have a solution.
I've separated the `direction == 0` condition into two statements.
one handles the moving if there is no `row` offset (essentially, when the moving text is only on 1 line), and the other handles text movement if the block of text goes across multiple lines.
i've also increased the ranges which end with `self.write_column` by 1 so that the last character is deleted (yay) (lines 107 and 114)

10:17
to debug with gdb, run `gdb -ex 'file target/x86_64-sketchOS/debug/sketch_os'`, which auto-runs the file (saves time i swear)

10:24
found an error (thank you gdb)
the first if statement breaks if the column = 0 (i didn't add a condition to handle that)
fix:
added 
```
if col == 0 {
    self.buffer.chars[row-1][BUFFER_WIDTH-1].write(character);
}
```
at vga_buffer.rs:109

10:34
tried to setup dap again and it DOESN'T WORK OF COURSE
gonna take a break

10:49
ok i took a break

10:59
added a script debug.sh which debugs program

11:14
finalized the script :)

12:22
an error on line 107:
i added an additional condition `self.write_column == 0`; moving it to seperate if statement as it needs to be handled seperately

12:49
deletion works now backwards...

15:51
went gym B)
move_chars <- works, committing and pushing
